# CSS-Techniques
This is a single part addition showing how to use css in different ways. I will focus on using images inside of texts. The article showed multiple ways of using images as the a background in text. It also showed how to make the image move wish I thought would be useful when creating a gaming site and the game worms actually came to mind when I saw it. This technique needs to be used sparingly though because it definitely will have the ability to make a page look too busy.



Page I used to take this technique from:
